# Centralized Logging System

## Description
A centralized logging system is a modern DevOps solution that collects application logs from multiple services and stores them in a single, unified location. It enables efficient monitoring, faster troubleshooting, and improved system reliability by giving administrators and developers full visibility into application behavior in real time.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a centralized logging system using DevOps best practices. The objective is to automatically generate application logs, centralize them, and make them available for monitoring and debugging through containerized and automated workflows.

## Technologies Used
- Python / Node.js
- Docker
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Kubernetes

## Project Objectives
- Automatically generate application logs
- Centralize logs for easy access and analysis
- Automate build and deployment using CI/CD pipelines
- Deploy the logging application on a Kubernetes cluster
